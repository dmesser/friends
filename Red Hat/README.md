# Red Hat

- [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) is sponsoring development of the SigStore project and a variety of related tools
- Red Hat is looking to operationalize SigStore via [Kubernetes Operators](https://operatorhub.io/operator/sigstore-helm-operator)
- [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is investing to support signed container images and signed manifests using `cosign`
- [Quay](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay) has been enhanced to support storing signed images and further integration into Quay builds and the Quay UIs are planned

Red Hat is looking at the SigStore project as a huge stepping stone to help the open source community embrace signing of released software projects just like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) helped embraced HTTPS/TLS in the modern web. It's a key part towards attestable and auditable supply chain security.
